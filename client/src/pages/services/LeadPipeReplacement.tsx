          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Lead pipes are a common issue in homes built before 1970 across England. Over time, these lead pipes pose a significant health risk due to the potential for lead to leach into your drinking water. If your property in Edinburgh, Glasgow, or anywhere else in England still uses lead water pipes, lead pipe replacement is the safest solution to ensure clean, safe drinking water for your household.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
            At English Water, we provide professional lead pipe replacement services using advanced, trenchless technology (impact moling) to minimise disruption while delivering long-lasting results. Our expert team operates across England, helping homeowners with lead pipe replacement to improve water quality.

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-4">Regulation and Water Safety Standards in England</h3>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
              In England, lead levels in drinking water are governed by the Water Supply (Water Quality) (England) Regulations 2010, which set the current legal limit at <strong>10 micrograms per litre (10 µg/L)</strong>.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">This reflects a significant improvement from earlier standards:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
              <li>50 µg/L in the late 1980s</li>
              <li>25 µg/L by 2003</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
              The long-term ambition is to reduce the limit as close to zero as possible, in line with WHO guidance. Public health experts increasingly advocate adopting the EU's upcoming 5 µg/L standard, particularly for vulnerable populations like children and pregnant women.

            <li><strong>Water Testing:</strong> Free testing is available if lead pipes are suspected. A sample is taken from your cold kitchen tap.</li>
            <li><strong>Results:</strong> If lead exceeds 10 µg/l, or 5 µg/l from April 2025, Scottish Water may replace its section. You must replace your private section first.</li>

          {/* Why Replace Lead Pipes */}

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Replacing lead pipes is essential to protect your household from potential health risks and improve the quality of your water supply. Here's why lead pipe replacement is important:
          </p>
          <div className="space-y-4 mb-8">
            <div>
              <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-2">1. Health Risks</h4>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
                Lead can leach into drinking water from old lead pipes, posing serious health risks, particularly to young children and pregnant women. Lead exposure has been linked to developmental issues and other long-term health problems, making it critical to replace lead pipes as soon as possible.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-2">2. Improved Water Quality</h4>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
                Replacing lead pipes eliminates the risk of lead contamination, significantly improving the safety and quality of your drinking water. Many homeowners also notice an improvement in the taste and clarity of their water after the lead pipe replacement work.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-2">3. Increased Property Value</h4>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
                Modernising your plumbing system by replacing lead pipes can enhance the value of your property. Homes with updated lead-free water systems are more attractive to potential buyers and meet today's safety standards.

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            While full pipe replacement is the only permanent solution, temporary steps can reduce exposure:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
            <li>Use only cold water for drinking or cooking.</li>
            <li>Run taps for several minutes before use.</li>
            <li>Clean faucet aerators regularly.</li>
            <li>Use point-of-use filters certified for lead removal.</li>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
              Partial lead pipe replacement—replacing only the public or private section—can dislodge built-up lead particles and temporarily increase contamination. <strong>Full lead pipe replacement of both sections is strongly advised</strong> to eliminate the risk.
            </p>

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
            <li>Flush your system by running all cold taps for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove and clean aerators.</li>
            <li>Avoid using kettles or ice makers during flushing.</li>
            <li>Notify Scottish Water for a follow-up inspection.</li>

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Lead in drinking water remains a hidden but serious concern for older Scottish homes. If your property was built before 1970, it may still contain lead pipe. Don't wait—book a water test, inspect your plumbing, and arrange for full lead pipe replacement if needed.

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
