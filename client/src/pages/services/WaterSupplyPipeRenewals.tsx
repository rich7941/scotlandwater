          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            The flow of water into your property is influenced by the condition of your private water supply pipe. If this pipe is in poor condition, it may restrict the water volume it carries, reducing the flow to your taps. Factors that can impact this include:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            <li>The diameter of the water supply pipe</li>
            <li>Corrosion within the water supply pipe and on appliances, particularly in iron water supply pipe, which can significantly reduce the internal diameter due to extensive corrosion</li>
            <li>The demand for water in your home at certain times</li>
            <li>The length of the water supply pipe</li>
            <li>Any leaks on your water supply pipe</li>
            <li>The pressure in the water main</li>
            <li>The number and type of fittings along the water supply pipe, such as ferrules, stop taps, meters, and bends</li>
            <li>Any inconsistencies in the water supply pipe, such as a partly shut stop tap, grit obstructing a ferrule or meter, damage, or internal corrosion.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-4">Lead Water Supply Pipes</h3>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            If your house was built before 1970 and hasn't been modernised, there's a good chance your water supply pipe may be made of lead.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            For homes with lead water supply pipes, it's advisable to run the cold tap for a few moments before using the water to drink. This helps flush out any water that has settled in the water supply pipe, particularly if it has been standing for a long time, such as overnight or during a holiday, when the concentration of lead can increase. Flushing the water supply pipe reduces the lead concentration in the water you consume.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            It is important not to drink water from the hot tap, as the concentration of lead tends to be higher. This is because hot water dissolves lead more effectively than cold water.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Water companies conduct regular checks to ensure that the water supply complies with government regulations. According to The Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations 2016, the maximum allowable concentration of lead per litre is 10 micrograms however lead is a common toxic metal with no safe level of consumption. It is a totally preventable poison.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
            If you are concerned that the lead concentration in your water may exceed this limit, or if you simply wish to modernise your property, replacing your lead water supply pipe could be a wise decision.

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-4">Lead Pipes in England: What Every Homeowner, Landlord, and Tenant Must Know</h3>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Across England, many homes built before 1970 still rely on outdated lead pipe for their water supply. These legacy pipes can pose a significant risk to health, especially for young children and pregnant women. While Scottish Water supplies clean, treated water that leaves their treatment works virtually lead-free, contamination can occur as water travels through private lead pipes underground or within your home.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
            This comprehensive guide explains everything you need to know about lead pipes in England: the risks, responsibilities, regulations, testing, short-term precautions, and the only long-term solution—full lead pipe replacement.
          </p>

          {/* Health Risks */}
          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-4">Health Risks of Lead in Drinking Water</h3>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-3">
            <strong>Children:</strong> Exposure to lead can result in developmental delays, learning difficulties, behavioural problems, and reduced IQ.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-3">
            <strong>Pregnant Women:</strong> Lead can cross the placenta and harm the developing baby, increasing the risk of low birth weight and miscarriage.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <strong>Adults:</strong> Long-term exposure can contribute to kidney problems, high blood pressure, memory loss, and fertility issues.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
            There is no safe level of lead exposure, and the effects are cumulative. The only way to eliminate the risk is to remove the lead at its source.
          </p>

          {/* How Lead Gets Into Your Water */}
          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-4">How Lead Gets Into Your Water</h3>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Lead is not present in water at the source or in public water mains. Contamination happens when treated water passes through private lead pipes and fittings. The longer the water is in contact with these materials—such as overnight or during the day while you're out—the more lead can dissolve into it.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Lead can also enter drinking water through:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
            <li>Internal lead pipe</li>
            <li>Lead-based solder on copper pipes (banned for drinking water since 1987, but may still exist)</li>
            <li>Old brass fixtures and fittings</li>
            <li>Lead-lined water storage tanks in lofts of older homes</li>
          </ul>

          {/* Regulations and Legal Limits */}
          <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-4">Regulations and Legal Limits</h3>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            The current UK legal limit for lead in drinking water is 10 micrograms per litre (10 µg/L). However, from 1 April 2025, Scottish Water will begin replacing lead communication pipes (their responsibility) when levels exceed 5 µg/L. Internationally, the European Union has committed to reducing the maximum lead level to 5 µg/L by 2036, and pressure is mounting for the UK to follow suit.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            England also enforces legal standards under:

          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            <li>Flushing taps regularly (3 to 5 minutes in the morning).</li>
            <li>Use cold water only for drinking or cooking.</li>
            <li>Collect flushed water for reuse (e.g., watering plants).</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <strong>Corrosion Control by Scottish Water:</strong> Scottish Water adds orthophosphate at treatment works to coat internal pipe surfaces and reduce lead leaching. This is effective but not permanent, and interruptions can cause spikes in lead levels.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <strong>Long Supply Pipes Over 30 Metres:</strong> If the pipe is longer than 30 metres, flushing may be insufficient. Full replacement is strongly recommended.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
            <strong>Lead Pipes and Lead in Your Water: What You Need to Know:</strong> Even though Scottish Water's treated water is lead-free, contamination can occur through old private pipe. Identifying and replacing lead pipes is crucial for long-term safety.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Renovating makes for a good opportunity for water supply pipe replacement. If you are renovating an area of your home, this is the ideal time to inspect any newly exposed plumbing for signs of wear or damage.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Replacing your old water supply pipe when areas are already exposed for other work can save you money in the long run, as it eliminates the need to re-expose the pipe for future repairs.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
              This is particularly crucial if you are redoing your driveway—replacing your water supply pipe at the same time will prevent the inconvenience of having to disrupt your new driveway later to access the pipework.
