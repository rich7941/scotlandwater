              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-3">3.1 Scope of Work</h4>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                English Water provides water mains contracting services, including but not limited to water supply pipe replacement, maintenance, and repair.
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-3">3.2 Estimates and Quotes</h4>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                All quotes provided by English Water are estimates based on initial assessments. Final costs may vary due to unforeseen circumstances or additional work required. Prices are valid for one month from the date of the quotation.
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-3">3.3 Unforeseen Conditions</h4>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                In the event that our engineers encounter unusually hard or difficult ground conditions, buried obstacles such as hardcore, metal, cisterns, tanks, foundations, roads, or any other circumstances beyond our control, English Water reserves the right to adjust the contract terms and associated costs. If ground conditions are deemed unforeseen and affect the planned work, English Water will adjust the scope of work and associated costs accordingly, even if the project is already underway.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Adjustments to the contract terms may include extensions of time or additional compensation if unexpected conditions are encountered, thereby covering any additional costs incurred due to extended project duration or increased complexity.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-4 mt-8">4. Customer Responsibilities</h3>
              
              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-3">4.1 Access</h4>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Customers must ensure that English Water has adequate access to the work site. Any delays caused by lack of access will be the customer's responsibility.
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-3">4.2 Permits and Easements</h4>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Customers are responsible for obtaining any necessary permits or easements required for the work to be carried out. English Water can assist in this process but is not liable for any delays or issues related to permit acquisition.
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-3">4.3 Parking Arrangements</h4>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                We require parking for one van, towing a portable compressor, with a minimum of 10m in length. It is the customer's responsibility to arrange any parking suspensions, obtain visitors parking permits, or reserve parking. Failure to do so may result in aborted visit costs and parking fines being added to the final invoice.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-4 mt-8">5. Payment Terms</h3>

              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-3">5.2 Deposit</h4>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                All works will require a £500 or 10% deposit, whichever is higher, depending on plant, material, and other costs involved. Payment of the deposit constitutes agreement to these terms and conditions and forms a binding contract between the customer and English Water.
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-3">5.3 Late Payments</h4>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Late payments will incur interest at a rate of 8% per annum above the base rate of the Bank of England, calculated daily from the due date until payment is made. In addition, a fixed debt recovery cost will be applied as follows:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700">

                <li>Debts of £10,000 or more: £100</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-4 mt-8">6. Warranty and Liability</h3>
              
              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-3">6.1 Warranty</h4>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                The guaranteed term is 25 years and covers defective pipe material, poor workmanship, and failure of direct connections. Excluded from the guarantee is accidental damage by individuals or physical forces such as ground slip, heave, subsidence, or the effects of tree roots. The guarantee is nullified by excavations on to, or further connections to the supply pipe or any modifications made by parties other than English Water.
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-3">6.2 Liability</h4>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">

              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-4 mt-8">7. Termination</h3>
              
              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-3">7.1 Termination by Customer</h4>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                The customer may terminate the contract by providing 14 days written notice. The customer will be liable for all work completed up to the termination date.
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-3">7.2 Termination by English Water</h4>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                English Water reserves the right to terminate the contract if the customer breaches any of these terms and conditions. English Water will provide written notice of termination.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-4 mt-8">8. Dispute Resolution</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Any disputes arising from or in connection with these terms and conditions shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-4 mt-8">9. Privacy and Data Protection</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                English Water is committed to protecting your privacy. Any personal information collected will be used solely for the purposes of providing our services and will be handled in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-4 mt-8">10. Property and Risk</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Property and goods supplied by English Water, including underground water supply pipes and associated materials, shall remain the Company's property until all sums due from the customer (whether a contractor or property owner) are paid in full. The customer is responsible for covering all risks of loss, damage, or destruction of such goods from the time of installation until full payment is made.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                If the customer defaults on payment, English Water reserves the right to take the following actions:
              </p>
              <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700">
                <li><strong>Demand Payment:</strong> Formally demand the outstanding payment from the customer, including any applicable interest and debt recovery costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Action:</strong> Initiate legal proceedings to recover the outstanding amount, including the unpaid sum, interest, and legal costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Charging Order:</strong> Apply for a charging order against the property where the work was performed to secure payment of the outstanding amounts. A charging order places a legal charge on the debtor's property, ensuring the debt is secured against the property and must be paid out of the proceeds if the property is sold.</li>
                <li><strong>Use of Debt Collection Agencies:</strong> Engage the services of a professional debt collection agency to recover the outstanding amount on behalf of English Water.</li>
              </ol>

              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-3">10.1 Property Owner's Liability in Contractor Default</h4>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                In cases where English Water is employed by a contractor, and the contractor defaults on payment, English Water reserves the right to hold the property owner liable for unpaid amounts through the following mechanisms:
              </p>
              <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700">
                <li><strong>Charging Order:</strong> English Water reserves the right to apply for a charging order against the property where the work was performed to secure payment of the outstanding amounts.</li>
                <li><strong>Notification of Potential Liability:</strong> Property owners are hereby notified that they may be held responsible for unpaid amounts if the contractor fails to pay English Water. This includes the right to seek payment directly from the property owner under applicable laws.</li>
              </ol>

              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-3">10.2 Acceptance of Terms by Property Owner</h4>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                By allowing work to commence on their property by a contractor employing English Water, the property owner is deemed to have accepted these terms and conditions.
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-3">10.3 Advisement to Property Owners</h4>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Property owners are strongly advised to:
              </p>
              <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700">
                <li>Ensure that any contractors employing English Water have made full payment for services rendered by English Water.</li>
                <li>Be aware of the potential for a charging order on their property if payment is not made by the contractor.</li>
                <li>Request proof of payment from the contractor to English Water before making final payments to the contractor.</li>
              </ol>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-4 mt-8">11. Special Conditions</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                If the customer's order contains special conditions, the order will only be accepted on the understanding that those conditions are not at variance with English Water's terms and conditions. In case of variance, English Water's terms and conditions shall prevail.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-4 mt-8">12. Delays and Non-performance</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                English Water shall not be liable for delays or non-performance due to strikes, lock-outs, acts of third parties, or other events or conditions beyond its control.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-4 mt-8">13. Cancellation and Charges</h3>
              
              <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-3">13.1 Customer Cancellation</h4>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Cancellation of orders by the customer cannot be accepted without written agreement from English Water. A minimum of 1 week's notice is required.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-4 mt-8">14. Liability for Existing Pipework</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                English Water accepts no responsibility for any rust or limescale deposits that may occasionally be loosened in the customer's existing pipework when restoring full water pressure. This is beyond our control and is sometimes a natural consequence of high-pressure water flowing through older pipework.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-4 mt-8">15. Flooring and Surface Reinstatement</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                English Water will take up and put back flooring, including carpets, lino, tiles, and laminate, as best as possible upon completion of the works. The customer may need to organize a relevant tradesperson to put back the flooring to a higher specification. All tarmac areas will be reinstated, but English Water does not guarantee a match in colour and texture with existing tarmac surfaces.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-4 mt-8">16. Legal Responsibilities</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                The customer is responsible for obtaining all required permissions, such as Opening Notices, Rights of Access, Easements, and tree preservation orders. English Water takes no responsibility for works not carried out in accordance with these requirements.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-4 mt-8">17. Entire Agreement</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                These conditions constitute the entire agreement between the customer and English Water. If the customer provides incorrect or misleading information to English Water, and this results in fines or costs for damages, these fines or costs will be the responsibility of the customer.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-4 mt-8">18. Post Works Investigations & Remedials</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
                Should the client feel that there are any remedials after we have carried out works, or subsequent issues that result that the client feels are due to our works, these should be brought to our attention immediately. No external contractor or third party should be involved and no costs accrued by the client without English Water's explicit prior written permission. English Water will not be responsible or liable to reimburse the client for any costs incurred in the client choosing to rectify issues themselves without our prior permission. English Water will always have the first opportunity to rectify any issues at their own cost where it is accepted by English Water that it is their responsibility to do so in line with our terms as outlined in the quotation.
