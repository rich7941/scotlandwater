            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Lead is a toxic heavy metal that has been used in plumbing systems since Roman times. In fact, the word plumbing comes from the Latin word plumbum, meaning lead. For many centuries, lead pipe was favoured for plumbing due to its durability, flexibility, and ease of installation. It was commonly used for both internal plumbing and the pipe that connects a property to the mains supply.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Lead is a toxic heavy metal. Even in small amounts, it can be harmful if consumed over time. It is especially dangerous for unborn babies and children under the age of six, whose bodies and brains are still developing.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
              The World Health Organization advises that there is no safe level of exposure to lead. For children, lead exposure can affect brain development and behaviour. Pregnant women are also at higher risk, as lead can cross the placenta and affect the unborn baby. In adults, lead exposure may contribute to high blood pressure and kidney issues.

            <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-6">Why Is Lead in Drinking Water a Problem?</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Lead water pipes may no longer be installed in modern homes, but they remain embedded in England's housing stock—especially in pre-1970s buildings. As long as lead pipes remain in place, there will be a risk, particularly in households with vulnerable residents.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Until every lead pipe in England is removed, lead will continue to pose a measurable threat to public health. The only way to be certain your water is free from lead is to test it and, if necessary, replace the source.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
              It might not seem like a small amount of lead in drinking water could cause harm—but if consumed regularly over time, lead builds up in the body and can become dangerous.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Disturbance to lead pipes—such as during nearby roadworks or home renovations—can temporarily increase lead levels in your tap water. If you've had work done on or near your property, it is advisable to run your cold taps for 10 minutes to flush out any water that may have absorbed lead particles.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
              To stay on the safe side, it's a good idea to run your cold water tap for at least two minutes before using the water for drinking or cooking—especially if the water has been sitting in the pipes overnight or after a long period of non-use.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Historically, lead was widely used across England in various applications, including petrol, paint, and plumbing systems. Before the 1970s, it was standard practice to use lead pipes to connect homes to the public mains water supply, thanks to lead's malleability and resistance to corrosion. This practice continued until the health risks of lead exposure became widely recognised.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
              In 1969, the use of lead pipes in new plumbing installations was officially banned in England. However, many older properties—particularly those built before this date—may still contain lead pipes, especially in underground supply lines or internal plumbing that hasn't been modernised. As long as these legacy pipes remain in place, there is a risk that lead may leach into drinking water.

            <h2 className="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-[#1B3A6B] mb-6">How Lead Enters the Water Supply</h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Water sourced from Scottish reservoirs and treated at Scottish Water's works does not contain lead. There are no lead water mains in England's public supply network. However, water can still become contaminated as it travels through private plumbing that contains lead.

              The risk increases when water remains stagnant in lead pipes for several hours—such as overnight or during periods of low use—allowing lead to dissolve into the water. The longer the water stands still, the greater the amount of lead that can leach into it.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
              Disturbance to lead pipes—such as nearby roadworks, construction, or renovations—can temporarily increase lead levels. Vibrations or disruption can dislodge particles inside the pipe, causing short-term spikes in contamination. This is why it is advisable to run your cold tap for at least 10 minutes if work has taken place near your property.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
              Even if your property no longer has lead pipes, lead may still enter the water supply through old fittings, solder joints, or tanks. These components can also contribute small but harmful amounts of lead.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
              Lead dissolves more easily in soft water, which is common in many parts of England. This makes Scottish homes particularly vulnerable to lead contamination, especially where old pipes remain in place. Soft water has fewer minerals, which means it provides less of a protective coating inside pipes that would otherwise reduce lead absorption.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
              Although rare, small amounts of naturally occurring lead can sometimes be found in Scottish groundwater—particularly in areas with a history of mining. For example, regions such as Leadhills and Wanlockhead in South Lanarkshire and Dumfries and Galloway have a long legacy of lead mining. These areas may experience localised lead contamination in soil and water, but this is not a widespread issue across England.
