              Lead Pipe Replacement in England: Responsibilities, Challenges, and Best Practice
            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Across England, many older properties—particularly those built before 1970—still rely on outdated lead pipes to supply drinking water from the public main into homes. Replacing these pipes is the only permanent way to eliminate the risk of lead exposure from domestic water systems. However, the process can be complex due to split ownership of the pipe and various practical barriers to full lead pipe replacement.

              Why Lead Pipes Are a Problem
            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Lead is a toxic metal that was commonly used in plumbing due to its flexibility and ease of installation. However, we now know that even low levels of lead exposure can have serious health effects. When drinking water comes into contact with lead pipes, lead can dissolve into the water—particularly if the water has been sitting still for several hours.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              In the private rented sector, changes to the Repairing Standard mean that from March 2024, landlords are legally required to ensure that no lead pipes are present in the drinking water supply of any property they let.

              Lead pipes are a hidden danger that continue to affect homes across England. They may be buried underground or concealed behind plaster, but their impact on health is very real. While chemical treatment can help reduce risk, it is not a substitute for lead pipe replacement.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              The safest and most certain way to protect your household from lead in drinking water is to replace all lead pipes with approved, modern materials.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Partial lead pipe replacement occurs when only one part of the lead pipe—either the communication pipe (public side) or the supply pipe (private side)—is replaced, while the other section remains in place.

                This approach is not recommended, and in some circumstances may temporarily increase lead levels in the water. That's because disturbing the existing lead pipe during a partial lead pipe replacement can dislodge scale and lead particles built up inside the pipe over time.

              Partial lead pipe replacement does not remove the source of contamination and may create a false sense of security if no follow-up testing is carried out. In line with UK best practice, Scottish households are strongly advised to do full lead pipe replacement—public and private sections together—to ensure the risk is fully removed.
