# Scotland to England Change - Deployment Status

## Code Changes Verified ✓
- Changed 174 instances of "Scotland" to "England"
- Modified 38 files
- Committed to Git (commit 13e9b43)
- Pushed to GitHub successfully

## Sample Verification from Source Code:
Hero.tsx now shows:
- "England's Water Main Repair and Replacement Experts"
- "24/7 assistance from expert water engineers across England"

## Deployment Issue
The live website at https://scotlandwater.netlify.app is still showing "Scotland" references.

This indicates that either:
1. Netlify build is still in progress
2. There's a caching issue
3. The build needs to be manually triggered

## Next Steps
Need to wait for Netlify auto-deployment to complete or manually trigger a rebuild.
